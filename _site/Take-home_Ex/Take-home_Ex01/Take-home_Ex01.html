<h1>Project Brief</h1>
<p><strong>Exploring Population Statistics of the City of Engagement</strong><br>
Design a user-friendly and interactive solution that helps city managers and planners to explore complex population data in an engaging way and reveal hidden patterns. This project aims to reveal the <strong>demographic and financial characteristics</strong> of the City of Engagement, using appropriate static and interactive statistical graphics methods in R.</p>
</section>
<section id="project-objectives" class="level1">
<h1>Project Objectives</h1>
<p>The city aims to use the data to assist with their major community revitalization efforts, including how to allocate a very large city renewal grant they have recently received. <strong>To support this process, the target metric of this study will be <em>joviality</em>, and the aim of this project will thus be to identify demographic gaps in joviality and areas for development through exploratory data analysis and visualisation. This would enable urban planners to focus their efforts on specific areas of the community to increase overall joviality of the population.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Initial Insights from Summary Statistics</strong><br>
<br>
There seems to be a fairly even distribution of participants across <strong>joviality</strong>, <strong>householdSize</strong>, <strong>age</strong> and <strong>interestGroup</strong>. There are more participants who do not have children, and approximately half of them have attained the highest education at high school or college level. The distributions and correlations of these variables will be investigated further in subsequent sections, after appropriate data wrangling techniques have been applied.</p>

<br>
<strong>Changing Data Types</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>participantId</strong> is classified as <code>&lt;dbl&gt;</code>, numerical continuous data, instead of nominal. This is cast as <code>&lt;chr&gt;</code> class using <code>as.character()</code></li>
<li><strong>educationLevel</strong> is classified as <code>&lt;chr&gt;</code> categorical data, and consists of four levels, with inherent hierarchy. This variable is cast as factor type on an ordinal scale using the <code>ordered()</code> function</li>
<li><strong>householdSize</strong> and <strong>interestGroup</strong> are classified as <code>&lt;dbl&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;chr&gt;</code> respectively, but are categorical in nature with different levels. These variables are cast as factors using <code>as.factor()</code></li>

<p>From the output, there are zero missing values across all columns in <strong>financial_data</strong>. Summary statistics revealed that a total of 1,513,636 financial transactions were captured over a year from March 2022 to February 2023.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="focusbox focus">
<p><strong>Initial Insights from Summary Statistics</strong></p>
<p>There seems to be a skewed distribution of transactions, with a higher proportion (0.522) falling under <strong>category: Food</strong> followed by <strong>category: Wage.</strong> Transaction <strong>amount</strong> has a wide range due to negative and positive values, and a skewed distribution due to large difference between 95th percentile value (159.561) and highest value (4096.526). The distributions and correlations of these variables will be investigated further in subsequent sections, after appropriate data wrangling and transformation techniques have been applied.</p>

<strong>Data Quality Issues</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>participantId</strong> is classified as <code>&lt;dbl&gt;</code>, numerical continuous data, instead of nominal. This is cast as <code>&lt;chr&gt;</code> class using <code>as.character()</code></li>
<li><strong>category</strong> is classified as <code>&lt;chr&gt;</code>, but is categorical in nature with six different levels. These is cast as factor type using <code>as.factor()</code></li>
<li><strong>timestamp</strong> contains both Date and Time, which is not suitable for analysis. Year-Month is extracted and saved into a separate variable, <strong>transDate</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>amount</strong> is reflected as a numeric value with 3 decimal places. This is rounded to 2 d.p. to reflect standard currency structure while maintaing accuracy.</li>

<p><strong>Insights from Boxplot</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Transactions are either outflows (-ve value) or inflows (+ve value)</li>
<li><strong>Wage</strong>, <strong>Shelter</strong> and <strong>RentAdjustment</strong> have a larger range of values compared to Recreation, Food and Education</li>
<li><strong>Wage</strong> seems to be made up of ‘clusters’ of points, with a gap in between higher wage groups and lower wage groups</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><br>
<br>
New aggregate variables are computed based on this for further analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>numTrans</strong>: Total Number of transactions per participant</li>
<li><strong>netAmount</strong>: Net Total amount ($) of transactions per participant = (Inflow - Outflow)</li>
<li><strong>expenseRatio</strong>: % of inflow that is spent (outflow) per participant</li>
<li><strong>out_pctEdu, out_pctFood, out_pctRec, out_pctShelter</strong>: % contribution to cash outflow by category</li>
<li><strong>in_pctWage, in_pctRentAdj</strong>: % contribution to cash inflow by category</li>

<p>To derive home ownership from financial transactions, we filter out participants with transactions in the <em>‘RentAdjustment’</em> category. This is based on the assumption that <em>‘RentAdjustment’</em> is additional rental income for the participant, who is the home owner. A new boolean variable, <strong>homeOwner</strong>, is created to reflect this.</p>

<p>We seek to find out if specific groups within the population have reported lower or higher joviality scores, and if this difference between factor levels in the sample is significant enough to represent the overall city population.<br>
A normality assumption test is first conducted across factor levels for joviality score across income and age groups. At a confidence level of 95%, we test the following hypothesis:<br>
&nbsp; <span class="math display">\[H_0: Joviality\ is\ normally\ distributed\ across\ groups\]</span><br>
<span class="math display">\[H_1: Joviality\ is\ not\ normally\ distributed\ across\ groups\]</span><br>

<p>Since the p-value across each income group is &lt; significance level 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis, concluding that <strong>joviality does not follow a normal distribution across income groups</strong>. To test if there is a significant difference between groups, a non-parametric test will be used in subsequent analysis, with median value as measure of central tendency.</p>

<p>The p-value is &lt; significance level of 0.05, so we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that median joviality differs among income groups. In fact, there is a large difference in mean joviality between low income and high income groups, <strong>with participants in low income groups having greater joviality (median = 0.75) than higher income groups (median = 0.23).</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp; While the one-way ANOVA tests reported significant differences in joviality between income groups and not age groups, there are still trends that can be observed when comparing multiple groups and factor levels. This gives more specific insight into demographic patterns, as visualised in the following chart that compares joviality score across both Age and Income groups:</p>
