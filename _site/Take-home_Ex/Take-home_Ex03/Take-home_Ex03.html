<h1>Project Brief</h1>
<p>FishEye International, a non-profit focused on countering illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing, has been given access to an international finance corporation’s database on <strong>fishing related companies.</strong> In the past, FishEye has determined that companies with anomalous structures are far more likely to be involved in IUU (or other <em>fishy</em> business). FishEye has transformed the database into a knowledge graph, including information about companies, owners, workers, and financial status. FishEye is aiming to use this graph to identify anomalies that could indicate if a company is involved in IUU.</p>

<h1>Project Objectives</h1>
<p>This study aims to use visual analytics to understand patterns of groups in the knowledge graph. This will endeavour to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>develop a visual analytics process to find similar companies and group them</strong></li>
<li><strong>focus on presenting key features of the business to the user</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This will be done through investigating the following variables:</p>

<p><code>skim()</code> shows that the <strong>links</strong> data consists of 1160 unique source and 2140 unique target nodes. To reducing the dimensionality of the data is thus imperative in creating useful network visualisations. Further exploratory analysis needs to be conducted to deduce the filtering criteria for determining anomalous groups.</p>

<p><strong>Initial Insights:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Nodes data</strong> seems to list all names of Companies, Beneficial Owners as well as Company Contacts in the Fishing Network. Majority of the companies are based in *ZH<strong> and </strong>Oceanus<strong>, with Company Contacts and Beneficial Owners overwhelmingly from </strong>ZH**. This suggests that the businesses are concentrated within a smaller geographical scope.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Links Data</strong> has ‘source’ and ‘target’ columns, and seem to denote the relationship of individuals (target) to companies (source), as well as classifying the relationship as <strong>type: Company Contact</strong> or <strong>Beneficial Owner</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Counting the number of individuals per type revealed a much larger variation in <strong>Beneficial Owner</strong> Count, which could be a good variable to use in classifying the company as Publicly listed (high number of beneficial owners - shareholders) or Sole Proprietorship (Single Beneficial Owner). However, this will also have to be further analysed in tandem with company revenue when grouping similar companies together.</p></li>

<p>Firstly, the company ownership and company contact structure can be visualised through plotting network graphs. This will give a better sense of how the individual records listed in the <strong>links</strong> data are related, as well as sieve out possible <em>fishy</em> patterns. The following filters are used to investigate possible ‘groups’ and anomalies:</p>
<ul>
<li>High Revenue &amp; Companies with Higher numbers of Beneficial Owners</li>
<li>Company Contacts of High Revenue Companies</li>
<li>Unreported Revenue &amp; Higher numbers of Beneficial Owners</li>
<li>Company Contacts of Companies with Unreported Revenue</li>

<li>Two Company Nodes with completely overlapping Beneficial Owners can be observed in the network, which could be suggestive of a <strong>Shell</strong> and <strong>Front</strong> company structure, or <strong>an attempt to conceal revenue</strong>.</li>
<li>Network of Company Contacts show that most companies in the High Revenue band have a single contact. Identifying companies with abnormally large numbers of contacts could be a possible sign of <em>fishy</em> company structure</li>

<p>The fishing industry is a transboundary operation, and vessels or companies that operate between different jurisdictions may often evade law enforcement authorities.

<li>Explorations revealed that most frequently declared products/services are related to the fishing industry. This is unsurprising.</li>
<li>A high number of other food-related and shipping-related services were also uncovered. In fact, companies that provide <strong>non fishing-related products or services</strong> could be filtered out as possible brokers for <em>fishy</em> networks</li>
<li>There are several overlaps in the frequent bigrams, that may be grouped together as the same category. The most frequent bigrams and words in the wordcloud above will be used as a base for product/service company categories.</li>

<h1>4: A <em>Fishy</em> Network</h1>
<p>Exploratory analysis thus far has revealed some underlying structures of various groups within the network. The most anomalous (and interlinked) sub-networks, <strong>High Revenue and High Link Count</strong> and <strong>Beneficial Owners with Multiple Companies</strong>, are concatenated to further investigate if these <em>fishy</em> structures are interlinked, as well as grouping companies and entities by categories.</p>
<p>The “group” that the entity is assigned is based on the following roles:</p>
<table class="table">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 24%">
<col style="width: 75%">
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><strong>Group</strong></th>
<th><strong>Logic</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Ultimate Beneficial Owner</strong></td>
<td>Beneficial Owner of &gt;= 20 Companies, a key player in the network</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Multi-role Entity</strong></td>
<td>Plays multiple roles within the network, may be a key personnel or broker within the network</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Beneficial Owner</strong></td>
<td>Shareholder of the company</td>
</tr>
