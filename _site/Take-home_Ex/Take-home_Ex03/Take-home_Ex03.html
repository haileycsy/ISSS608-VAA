<h1>Project Brief</h1>
<p>FishEye International, a non-profit focused on countering illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing, has been given access to an international finance corporation’s database on <strong>fishing related companies.</strong> In the past, FishEye has determined that companies with anomalous structures are far more likely to be involved in IUU (or other <em>fishy</em> business). FishEye has transformed the database into a knowledge graph, including information about companies, owners, workers, and financial status. FishEye is aiming to use this graph to identify anomalies that could indicate if a company is involved in IUU.</p>

<h1>Project Objectives</h1>
<p>This study aims to use visual analytics to understand patterns of groups in the knowledge graph. This will endeavour to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>develop a visual analytics process to find similar companies and group them</strong></li>
<li><strong>focus on presenting key features of the business to the user</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This will be done through investigating the following variables:</p>

<p><strong>Initial Insights:</strong><br>
* <strong>Nodes data</strong> seems to list all names of Companies, Beneficial Owners as well as Company Contacts in the Fishing Network. Majority of the companies are based in *ZH<strong> and </strong>Oceanus<strong>, with Company Contacts and Beneficial Owners overwhelmingly from </strong>ZH<strong>. This suggests that the businesses are concentrated within a smaller geographical scope.<br>
* </strong>Links Data<strong> has ‘source’ and ‘target’ columns, and seem to denote the relationship of individuals (target) to companies (source), as well as classifying the relationship as </strong>type: Company Contact<strong> or </strong>Beneficial Owner<strong>.<br>
* Counting the number of individuals per type revealed a much larger variation in </strong>Beneficial Owner** Count, which could be a good variable to use in classifying the company as Publicly listed (high number of beneficial owners - shareholders) or Sole Proprietorship (Single Beneficial Owner). However, this will also have to be further analysed in tandem with company revenue when grouping similar companies together.</p>
